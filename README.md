Angular4J is a framework whose intention is to use the JavaEE7 platform, and more specifically to CDI and EJB 3.1 specifications with the AngularJS framework. It was based on the AngularBeans Project (https://bessemhmidi.github.io/AngularBeans/), but was completely refactored, following a new line, meeting new security and performance requirements, establishing a new concept. Maintained by the company Teorema Sistemas (http://www.teorema.inf.br) where it makes available its technical team to develop it and to apply in its own products.

With the help of the free software community, the Teorema Sistemas seeks to develop its tools, as well as helping other developers do the same.

## Features:
- Generate ready to inject and callable AngularJS Service from CDI Beans.
- Handles HTTP/HTTPS methods calls.  
- Detailed control over server side and client side data updates.
- Handle real-time calls via WebSockets or SockJS integration.
- QueryModels: queries from server to client and updates the models.
- Events and queryModels broadcast.
- Built in i18n Translation.
- Event Driven, Real Time, and lightweight.
- Date in native format over server side and client side.
- Byte[] format over server side and Base64 on client side.
- EJB Beans and/or complex objects on the server side and client side transparently, allowing the use of interfaces, inheritance and generics.
- Inheritance in annotation.
- Work with generic attributes in method.
- Identification of creation and destruction of real-time sessions.
- Transition of compressed and encrypted data between client and server.
