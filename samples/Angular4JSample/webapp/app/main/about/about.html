		Angular4J is a framework whose intention is to use JavaEE7 -and more precisely the CDI specification- with AngularJS. It was based on the AngularBeans Project (<a href="https://bessemhmidi.github.io/AngularBeans/">https://bessemhmidi.github.io/AngularBeans/</a>), but it was completely refactored, following a new form, meeting new security and performance requirements, while maintaining the concept established by AngularBeans. Maintained by the company Teorema Sistemas (<a href="http://www.teorema.inf.br">http://www.teorema.inf.br</a>) where it makes available its technical team in order to develop it and to apply in its own products.
