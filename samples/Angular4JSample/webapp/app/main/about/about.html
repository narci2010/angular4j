		Angular4J is a framework whose intention is to use the JavaEE7 platform, and more specifically to CDI and EJB 3.1 
		specifications with the AngularJS framework. It was based on the AngularBeans Project 
		(<a href="https://bessemhmidi.github.io/AngularBeans/">https://bessemhmidi.github.io/AngularBeans/</a>), but was completely 
		refactored, following a new line, 
		meeting new security and performance requirements, establishing a new concept. Maintained by the company Teorema Sistemas 
		(<a href="http://www.teorema.inf.br">http://www.teorema.inf.br</a>) where it makes available 
		its technical team to develop it and to apply in its own products.
